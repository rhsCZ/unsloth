"""Checkpoint compaction: when a chat overflows, reset the epoch instead of trimming it.

The rolling window trims a little more on almost every reply (eight boundary moves on one
12-turn thread), breaking the prefix cache each time and forgetting things retrieval alone
does not restore: a standing instruction recalled as four passages was still not obeyed,
while the same instruction in plain view was obeyed every time.

So compaction is an EVENT, not a slope. When the next turn will not fit, context resets to
``[system prompt + X] + [newest user turn]``, with everything earlier reachable through
`search_conversation`. X is a bounded verbatim record of the user's standing instructions
from the dropped turns, built deterministically so there is no summariser to fail.

X lives in the SYSTEM message: unevictable by construction, needs no chat-template support,
and standing rules are exactly what compaction folds away. It labels itself a lossy record
rather than new policy, and delimiters in quoted text are escaped, because promoting user
words into the system role is an authority-confusion risk.

NOTHING IS STORED: the client re-sends the whole branch, so X is recomputed each request.

Two hard gates, both refusals: a reset needs the dropped turns ARCHIVED (never claim
searchable history that is gone), and needs `search_conversation` to be offerable at all
(a template that cannot take tools keeps the rolling window).
