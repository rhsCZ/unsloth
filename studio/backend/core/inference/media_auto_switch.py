"""Opt-in model auto-switch for the image and video generation APIs.

The chat twin lives in ``local_model_resolver`` + ``routes.inference``: a ``/v1`` request
naming a downloaded GGUF loads it before serving. Media had no equivalent, so
``POST /v1/images/generations`` answered 503 unless someone had already picked a model on the
Images page, and ``model`` was documented as informational. This resolves that name against
the downloaded image/video models, drains what the backend is doing, and runs the load the
picker would run.

Off by default (``media_api_auto_switch_model``), so existing clients see no change.

Only downloaded models resolve, and an unknown name is refused rather than answered by
whatever is resident. Nothing here starts a download: the media equivalent of the chat
auto-download setting would let one API key spend tens of GB, which is its own decision.

Both waits are bounded, because Unsloth's secure-mode tunnel caps an origin response near 100
seconds. Exceeding a bound leaves the work running and asks the caller to retry, the contract
``begin_load`` already gives the UI.

This module is the orchestration. The pieces it drives live next to it: ``media_model_index``
resolves a name and recognises the resident model, ``media_locality`` proves a pick is already
downloaded, ``media_switch_backends`` waits out work a switch would interrupt,
``media_switch_locks`` serializes switches, and ``media_switch_errors`` holds the refusals.
