"""Keep a provider's bytes off Unsloth's own control channel.

Unsloth multiplexes its UI control protocol onto the same SSE stream a provider's
chunks are relayed on. The chat client picks those frames out structurally: a
top-level ``type`` of ``tool_start`` / ``tool_end`` / ``tool_output`` /
``tool_args`` / ``tool_status`` (and the local-runtime ``diffusion_frame`` /
``reasoning_summary``) becomes a tool card, a badge or a canvas rather than
assistant text, as does a ``_toolEvent`` / ``_toolStatus`` key stamped inside an
otherwise ordinary chunk.

Every one of those frames is written by this server. A provider endpoint -- a
user-configured base_url, so not necessarily one Unsloth or the user controls --
has no legitimate reason to emit any of them, and a verbatim relay makes its copy
indistinguishable from ours at the client: a forged card can claim a tool the
user trusts ran and returned something harmless, carrying
``provenance: {"source": "local"}``, when nothing ran at all. So strip the
control vocabulary out of everything that arrives from a provider. The
``delta.reasoning`` alias Ollama and newer vLLM send is renamed to the canonical
``reasoning_content``, streamed deltas only. The rest of the chunk stays as it was.

class ServerToolCallStripper:
    """``strip_server_executed_tool_call`` with the one bit of turn state it needs.

    A turn whose calls this server runs is not over when the provider says it is, and the
    provider does not always say "tool_calls": llama.cpp and vLLM finish a structured call
    on "stop", which the loop runs anyway. Stripping only the call then leaves a caller
    holding an empty chunk marked ``finish_reason: "stop"``, and a client that ends the
    turn there never reads the answer the loop is about to stream -- the same lost reply
    the control-frame gate exists to prevent, arrived at from the other side.

    So remember, per stream, that a call was withheld and no reply has followed it, and
    treat the "stop" that closes that turn the way "tool_calls" is already treated. The
    next turn opens with the flag clear, so its own finish_reason is relayed untouched.

    The flag is raised BEFORE the strip reads it, because a provider may co-emit the call
    and the finish_reason on one line (any non-streamed upstream relayed as a single line
    does), and the turn boundary is read on every line, because that same line both opens
    and closes the turn. Getting either wrong leaks the empty "stop" this exists to hold
    back, or swallows a later turn's legitimate one.

    Blanking the last finish_reason of a stream would leave the caller none at all --
    openai-node raises "missing finish_reason for choice 0" outright -- so the withheld
    ones are counted and ``owed_terminal_chunk`` mints a replacement when the loop ends
    without opening the turn it promised (a spent tool budget, a discarded call, a
    provider that failed mid-loop).

    One instance per request. The state is per line, not per choice index, which is exact
    here because the loop reads choice 0 only and this path rejects n > 1 upstream.
