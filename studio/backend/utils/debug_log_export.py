"""Pack every log the viewer may read into one redacted ZIP.

Same allowlist as the picker (`debug_log_sources.list_sources`) through the same
`redact_log_text`, so the bundle can hold no file, and no credential, the tab
would not have shown.

The per-family cap upstream bounds FILES, not bytes, and the session log is
never rotated. Hence two more bounds here, a tail per file and a budget across
all of them, both cutting from the FRONT: the end of a log explains the problem.
