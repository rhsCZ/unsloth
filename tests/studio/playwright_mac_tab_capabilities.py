    *timeout* bounds the entire probe: DNS, connect, response headers and body. It is
    not a per-socket-operation timeout, and it must not be turned back into one.

    That distinction is the whole reason this wrapper exists. urllib's own timeout
    applies to each socket operation separately, so any peer that keeps sending
    something, anything, more often than the timeout holds the call open forever. Each
    layer was bounded in turn and the hole simply moved: capping the body read left
    urlopen able to block indefinitely while response HEADERS trickled, because urlopen
    has not returned yet at that point and the body deadline never gets to run. Bounding
    the next layer down would only move it again, to the redirect chain or the TLS
    handshake. A deadline outside all of them cannot be outflanked by any of them.

    The probe therefore runs on a daemon thread and this joins it for at most *timeout*.
    A join that expires is a timeout, and the thread is abandoned rather than waited on:
    it is a daemon, so it cannot hold up interpreter exit, and _probe_once carries its
    own body deadline and size cap so an abandoned one still lets go of its socket
    instead of buffering forever. Those inner bounds are hygiene for the abandoned case;
    the join is what actually enforces the budget.

    Abandoning a thread per hung probe is affordable here because a backend that hangs
    probes is one this script is about to report on and exit.
